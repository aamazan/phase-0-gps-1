>What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Commits, branching, and merging.

>What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Commits, branching, merging, staging, and fetching (I wasn't even aware of the last two until this session, to be completely honest).

>What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
As I only had a guide, I made sure to ask him about the different commands, as well as a few different usability questions for Git and Github.

>What still confuses you about Git?
Honestly, I'm still trying to make sure I remember the commands and stage structure. They're really important and I don't want to mess things up for my partners when we finally do a group project.

>How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was very insightful. I learned a lot from Kit and enjoyed talking with him about Git and different tools we have available.
